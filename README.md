# geospatial-explore
Using packages such as geopandas and folium, I used some Nashville data to explore GIS data and mapping.

Data was pulled from data.nashville.gov. The two datasets are:

1. Bike Racks which contains locations and characteristics of bicycle racks throughout Davidson County, including Metro-owned racks, some privately-owned racks, and art installation racks.

2. Metro Parks Boundaries which contains outlines of each Metro Park, greenway property, Parks maintained school playgrounds and tennis courts.
